# Abstract Factory Pattern

## Overview
The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It's particularly useful when a system needs to be independent from how its products are created, composed, and represented.

## Implementation Example in Go
Let's consider a sports equipment shopping scenario to demonstrate the Abstract Factory pattern:

Imagine you're shopping for sports gear and have different brand options like Nike, Adidas, and Puma. Each brand produces common sports items like:
- Shoes
- T-shirts 
- Pants
- Caps

While these are common items, each brand has its own unique:
- Design style
- Materials
- Manufacturing process
- Branding elements

The Abstract Factory pattern helps organize this by:
1. Defining interfaces for each product category (IShoes, ITshirt, IPants, ICap)
2. Creating a SportsBrandFactory interface that can produce all these items
3. Implementing concrete factories for each brand (NikeFactory, AdidasFactory, PumaFactory)

This way:
- You can easily switch between different brands while maintaining consistent product categories
- Adding new brands doesn't affect existing code
- Product families stay together (Nike shoes match with Nike clothing)
- The shopping system remains independent of specific brand implementations

The pattern ensures you get a complete, matching set of sports gear from your chosen brand while keeping the code organized and maintainable.
