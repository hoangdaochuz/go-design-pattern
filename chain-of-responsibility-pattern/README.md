# Chain of Responsibility Pattern

## Overview
The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that creates a chain of handler objects for a request. Each handler contains a reference to the next handler in the chain and decides either to process the request or pass it to the next handler.

## Use Cases
- When you want to decouple senders and receivers of a request
- When multiple objects may handle a request and the handler isn't known beforehand
- When you want to issue a request to one of several objects without specifying the receiver explicitly

## Benefits
1. Reduces coupling between sender and receiver
2. Adds flexibility in assigning responsibilities to objects
3. Receipt of request is not guaranteed - it may fall off the end of the chain

## Example Scenario
Consider a support ticket system in a company:
- Level 1 Support handles basic issues
- If they can't resolve it, passes to Level 2 Support
- If Level 2 can't handle it, escalates to Level 3 Support
- If no one can handle it, notify the customer that additional investigation is needed
