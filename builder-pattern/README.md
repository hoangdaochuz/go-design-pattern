# Builder Pattern

The Builder pattern allows complex objects to be constructed step by step, separating the construction process from the object's representation.

## Problem It Solves
- Allows creation of complex objects with numerous configuration options
- Separates construction logic from the object's business logic
- Enables creating different representations of the same object
- Provides better control over the construction process

## Example Use Case
In this example, we demonstrate a house construction system where different types of houses (regular house, igloo, etc.) can be built step by step. The builder handles the construction details while keeping the construction process consistent.

## Key Components
- **Director**: Defines the order in which to execute the building steps
- **Builder Interface**: Specifies methods for creating parts of the product
- **Concrete Builders**: Provide specific implementations of the building steps
- **Product**: The complex object being built

## Benefits
- Allows fine control over the construction process
- Supports variation of internal representation of products
- Isolates code for construction and representation
- Provides better control over the construction process
- Enables objects to be constructed step by step

## When to Use
- When you need to create complex objects with multiple parts
- When you want to create different representations of the same object
- When you need fine control over the construction process
- When construction of an object needs to be independent of its parts

## Real-World Analogies
- Building a house following architectural plans
- Assembling a custom computer with specific components
- Creating a customized meal at a restaurant
- Manufacturing a car with various options and configurations
