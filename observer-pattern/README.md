# Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that establishes a one-to-many relationship between objects. When one object (the subject/publisher) changes state, all its dependents (observers/subscribers) are notified and updated automatically.

## Problem It Solves
- When changes to one object require changing others, and you don't know how many objects need to be changed
- When an object needs to notify other objects without making assumptions about who these objects are
- When you need to maintain consistency between related objects without making them tightly coupled

## Structure
- **Subject/Publisher**: The object that holds the state and sends notifications
- **Observer/Subscriber**: The objects that want to be notified about changes
- **Concrete Subject**: Specific implementation of the Subject
- **Concrete Observer**: Specific implementation of the Observer

## Example Use Cases
1. Event handling systems
2. News subscription services
3. Social media notifications
4. Stock market monitoring
5. User interface updates

## Benefits
- Loose coupling between objects
- Support for broadcast communication
- Establishes relationships between objects at runtime

## Drawbacks
- Memory leaks if observers aren't properly unsubscribed
- Random order of notifications
- Potential performance issues with many observers

## Implementation in Go
