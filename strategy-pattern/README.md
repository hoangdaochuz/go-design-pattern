# Strategy Pattern
The strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Example Use Case

Let's say we have a payment processing system that needs to handle different payment methods (Credit Card, PayPal, Crypto). Each payment method has its own processing logic but should be interchangeable from the client's perspective.
