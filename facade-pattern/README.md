# Facade Pattern

## Overview
The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, library, or framework. It acts as a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making the subsystem easier to use.

## Key Components
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to the complex subsystem
- **Subsystem Classes**: The complex system of classes that the facade encapsulates

## Benefits
1. **Simplification**: Reduces complexity by providing a simple interface to a complex system
2. **Decoupling**: Minimizes dependencies between client code and subsystem components
3. **Layer of Abstraction**: Hides implementation details from clients
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to subsystem don't affect client code

## Example Use Cases
- Interfacing with complex libraries or APIs
- Providing a unified interface to multiple related operations
- Wrapping legacy or complex code behind a cleaner interface
